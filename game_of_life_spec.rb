# The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, 
# each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. 
# Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically,
#  or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

#  Rule1   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
#  Rule2   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
#  Rule3   Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies
#  Rule4   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell

# The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 
# The first generation is created by applying the above rules 
#simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, 

# and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick 
# (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). 
# The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
